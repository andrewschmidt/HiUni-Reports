Designer,1,1,"Degree-granting, associate's and certificates",2,24.0102,Location,Complete the basics at community college,"Community college is a no-brainer. You’ll save on both tuition and housing costs — as long as you pick a community college close enough that you can live at home.

,,2,"Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above",2,50.04,ROI,Study design,"There are two important documents every designer should have by the time they finish their Bachelor’s degree. One is the degree.

The other is a diverse portfolio of work, showing not just the designer’s skill, but rather her growth over years studying the craft. Armed with both these documents, a Bachelor’s degree is all a designer should need to enter the workforce."

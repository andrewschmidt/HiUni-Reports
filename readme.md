# HiUni Reports

*HiUni Reports* is an automated college advisor that treats higher education like an investment — because it is one!

## What’s it do?

For a high school student, using *HiUni Reports* looks something like this:

1. Sign up with an email and password.
2. Fill out a questionnaire with details on your career choice, family’s income, budget, and location.
3. Wait.
4. Get an email from *HiUni* when your report is ready to view.

## What’s a report?

A report consists of three pathways. Each pathway is a step-by-step walkthrough of a different route you could take through higher education. These routes are carefully chosen to have a high return on investment (ROI).

A pathway is rarely as simple as attending one university for four years. For example, you might complete your general studies at community college, finish your degree at a university, then complete career-specific licensing via an online course.

## Could I run this myself?

Not quite. You need sources for a ton of data points about schools.

Some of this is easy to come by — BLS’s IPEDS system offers some info you can download (since it’s publically available and free, I’ve included the CSV file we use). 

But median salaries by major are much harder to find. We license that data where possible, and research the rest ourselves.

## I’ve noticed you didn’t do (insert best practice here)

Please let me know! I’m new to development and always learning.

## Can I hire you?

Sure!
